Jar Jar Links is a utility that makes it easy to repackage Java libraries
and embed them into your own distribution. This is useful for two reasons:

 * You can easily ship a single jar file with no external dependencies.

 * You can avoid problems where your library depends on a specific version
   of a library, which may conflict with the dependencies of another library.
